This is my first dive into the ASP.NET Web Application area using Visual Studio.

Below is our assignment description.

"Build an ASP.NET Web App using the same structure as in the "Building First Web App" series of videos. (i.e. Non-MVC)

Include:

Title
Header that lists your preferred name
A picture of yourself doing something you enjoy
A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class
A list of the Top #3 jobs you are most interested in pursuing when you graduate
A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage of each grade category listed in the syllabus
An icon for the website (displayed on the tab next to the title) (#notcoveredinthevideos)
Style the site using a CSS file.  Level of styling is up to you, but only CSS for now.  (No Bootstrap, Angular, etc. on this assignment. We'll get there!)

Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade using the "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus.

As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)"
