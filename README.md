This is my first dive into the ASP.NET Web Application area using Visual Studio. It's a two part assignment.

Below is our assignment description.

"Build an ASP.NET Web App using the same structure as in the "Building First Web App" series of videos. (i.e. Non-MVC)

Include:

Title
Header that lists your preferred name
A picture of yourself doing something you enjoy
A paragraph on what you hope to get out of this IS 413 class
A list of the Top #3 jobs you are most interested in pursuing when you graduate
A "Grade Calculator" form that takes as input a percentage of each grade category listed in the syllabus
An icon for the website (displayed on the tab next to the title) (#notcoveredinthevideos)
Style the site using a CSS file.  Level of styling is up to you, but only CSS for now.  (No Bootstrap, Angular, etc. on this assignment. We'll get there!)

Build a JavaScript program that calculates and displays both a final percentage and a letter grade using the "Grade Calculator" form entries based on the weights listed in the syllabus.

As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)"

"Convert the Web App you created in Assignment #1 to an MVC structure following the pattern in this week's videos.  Separate your Grade Calculator program into a second view and add navigation to access that page.  Create a model for your Grade Calculation form.

Be sure to include:

The basic jQuery selector ($) to select the elements in your JavaScript program.
Appropriate folders for each element of MVC.
A Controller to access the corresponding Views.
Razor code to set the text in the header.
A shared layout across all pages.
Tag helpers for navigation.
Validation in the model to ensure the user enters a number between 0 and 100 (#notcoveredinthevideos).
As always, write good code (use indentation, commenting, whitespace, descriptive variable names, etc.)"
